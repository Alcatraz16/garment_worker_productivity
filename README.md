# garment_worker_productivity
##Overview
The Garment Worker Productivity project aims to analyze and predict the productivity of garment workers based on various factors. This project leverages data science techniques, machine learning models, and data analysis to gain insights into worker performance and productivity trends.

##Features
Data analysis and preprocessing
Predictive modeling using machine learning (e.g., XGBoost, Linear Regression)
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Model evaluation and performance metrics
Insights and visualization of productivity trends

##Technologies Used
Python: Data processing and model building
Pandas, NumPy: Data manipulation
Scikit-learn, XGBoost: Machine learning models
Matplotlib, Seaborn: Data visualization
SQL: Data extraction and management

##Results
The model achieved high accuracy with the XGBoost algorithm, outperforming baseline models. Key insights and analysis are presented in the results/ directory.

This project is done by Sagnik Ghosh.
